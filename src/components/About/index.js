                                          <p>Hi there! My name is Justin Choy and I am a student at
                                                 UC Berkely Extension where I am currently learning how to code!</p>
                                          <p> I am a California based programmer where I have lived my entire life.</p>
                                          <p> I graduated from Saint Mary's College of California
                                                 in 2021 during COVID. My Major is in history but I also like politics,
                                                 fun books, and video games. The dream job I want to do is video game development to make fun games for eveyone!
